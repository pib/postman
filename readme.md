The Postman -- A book report in video game form
===============================================

A long time ago, in a city somewhat far away, I was given an
assignment to write a book report. Being lazy, and more interested in
playing around with my computer, I decided I'd make a video game
instead, and pass it off as a book report.

The game is a simple RPG with turn-based battles where your only two
options are "(F)ight" and "(R)un away".

So I did, in one night (because I was lazy and procrastinated), and
this is the result.

In its current form, it requires QBasic 4.5 to compile and/or run
(compiled is recommended, because then it runs way faster). QBasic
runs nicely in DosBox, and so does this game, in all it's original,
slow rendering glory.

Included is the original source for the tile editor, level editor, and
the game itself.
